# Descriptive Analysis for Liver Disease Clinical Data  
*A Statistical Exploration of Two Clinical Datasets: Indian Liver Patient Dataset & Liver Cirrhosis Dataset*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the descriptive statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for two widely used clinical datasets in hepatology research:

1. **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)**  
   → Binary classification: *Predict whether a patient has liver disease or not.*

2. **Liver Cirrhosis Dataset**  
   → Multiclass classification: *Predict the stage of cirrhosis (1–4).*

The goal of this analysis is to **understand the clinical structure** of the datasets, identify trends, verify statistical hypotheses, and prepare the foundation for later modeling (Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).

## Research Goals

- Perform **exploratory statistical analysis** on liver-related clinical indices.
- Identify **clinical indicators** strongly associated with liver disease conditions.
- Conduct **numerical and categorical statistical tests**:
  - ANOVA one-way
  - Chi-square test
  - Mean/variance comparison
  - Normality test (Q–Q plot)
- Analyze feature distributions using:
  - Histogram
  - Density plot (KDE)
  - Boxplot
  - Violin plot
- Detect and interpret **outliers** that represent abnormal clinical conditions.
- Generate **PCA and PDA projections** for data visualization and separability assessment.
- Summarize **insights essential for predictive modeling**.
